##  About Me

My name is **Liebe Adjicta**, a passionate cybersecurity and cloud enthusiast from **Togo 🇹🇬**.  
I’m driven by a deep desire to understand how technology works — and more importantly, how to **make it safer and more resilient** for everyone.

With a background in **Information and Cybersecurity** from the University of Kara, I’ve had the opportunity to work in a **Network Operation Center (NOC)** where I ensure the stability and reliability of digital infrastructures.  
Through this experience, I’ve learned that cybersecurity isn’t just about defense — it’s about **understanding systems, anticipating threats, and building trust** in the digital world.

I also hold the **Google Cloud Certified – Cloud Engineer** certification, and have explored several learning paths focused on **cloud security principles**.  
These experiences continue to shape my vision: a world where technology empowers people without compromising their safety.
